#Spotify Recently Added

This repository contains code to create a playlist with the N most recent days of liked songs.

This is so that I can isolate my recent additions to spotify and shuffle them as spotify does not allow this natively.

This code isn't intended to run but if you are interested in using it get in touch with me and I'll fix it up for public use.

It's hosted on a Heroku dyno with a scheduler attachment to run daily.
